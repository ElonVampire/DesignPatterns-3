# Design Patterns Library
Demo implementations of various design patterns based on the pluralsight course Design Patterns Library 

#What are they? 

design patters are generic solutions to commonly occuring problems that arise during software construction. Design patterns and reusable code while they share common aspects, are two distinct elements and should not be treated as one in the same. These are not based in the implementation of algorithms. PAtterns are more concerned with the formatting and relationships between classes to address commonly occuring problems. These are given specific names based on what problem they solve. This helps to give a common language between developers to help communicate problems in design and patterns used in their solution. These patterns deal with both high level system design as well as dealing with problems at a lower level of implementation. While patterns define parts of a pattern to be given ccertain names like "View" or "Model" these names are abstractions of and in a real implementation can be called anything. What matters is the structure of these classes have in relation to one another and the interfaces they use to talk to one another. Collaborators are classes that either interact directly with the pattern or are contained within the pattern. They dont supply a direct solution to a problem but instead give us tempaltes to solve our problems.

Patterns can be organized in differnt types, some of these include. 
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral
- Security
- Concurrency
- Sql
- User Interface
- Relational
- Social
- Distributed

Why they matter

Gives profession a shared language
Avoids having to re invent the solution to common problems
speeds up production teams
Improves the system and application design.

Criticisms 

Unnecessary duplication

weak points in languages
    Patterns are workarounds for missing language features. 

Same as other abstractions

#Adapter Pattern

#Bridge Pattern

#Builder Pattern
